‍e. Entire Agreement; Amendment; Interpretation. These Terms, including our Privacy Policy, contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions and matters contemplated herein, supersede all previous communications, understandings and agreements (whether oral or written) other than any click-through, order form or end user license agreement provided by us, and cannot be amended except by a writing signed by both parties or by our posting of an amended version of these Terms on our Website. The headings and captions used in these Terms are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting these Terms. If any part of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

‍f. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution. These Terms, and any dispute between you and us, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to principles of conflicts of law that would result in the application of the law of any other jurisdiction, except that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration provisions set forth below. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that this Section g. Below is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the arbitration procedures or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the City and County of San Francisco, California except that you or we are permitted (i) to bring small claims actions in state court in the county in which you reside if such court has a small claims procedure and if such court is located in the United States of America; (ii) to bring claims for injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction over the parties; or (iii) to seek enforcement of a judgment in any court having jurisdiction over the parties. To the extent permitted by law, you and we agree to waive trial by jury in any court proceeding.

‍g. Agreement to Arbitrate; Waiver of Class Action. ‍Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes; Arbitration Procedures. Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to your or our intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents) or for items (a)–(c) set forth in this Section., you agree that all disputes between you and us (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) arising out of or relating to these Terms, our Services, and/or our Privacy Policy shall be finally resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator conducted in the English language in the State of California under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), and the parties hereby expressly waive trial by jury. The parties shall appoint as sole arbitrator a person mutually agreed by you and us or, if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days of either party’s request for arbitration, such single arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA upon the request of either party. The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator). All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, application may be made to any court for a judicial acceptance of the award or order of enforcement. Under no circumstances shall the arbitrator be authorized to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms. ‍

h. Class Action Waiver. Any claims brought by either party must be brought in such party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You agree and acknowledge that neither you nor MUSTGAMES will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims related to these Terms and/or our Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You understand and agree that you may bring claims only on your own behalf. ‍

You must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. You must use this address to opt out: MUSTGAMES, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Out-Out, MUSTGAMES Inc, 440 N BARRANCA AVE #9893 COVINA, CA 91723, UNITED STATES.‍

j. Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to the arbitration procedures (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate the arbitration procedures from these Terms, such termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the version of these Terms not containing the arbitration procedures is posted to our Website, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of removal.For Additional Information.
